# The Monkees 

**The brief for this project is as follows:** 

>CREATE A WEBSITE FOR A BAND 
>
>Build a static (front-end only) website for a band. As a starting point, you may want to use wireframes, as we did in the UX lesson (you can use Balsamiq or any other tool, including just pen and paper). You can use either your assets or the assets within the following GitHub repo. 
>
>The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years’ experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives: 
>
>Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalogue, and any new material as it becomes available. 
>
>Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties. 
>
>The band has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website: 
>
>Photos of the band members 
>
>A video clip 
>
>Audio clips 
>
>Also, they are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages. 

As such, I set about creating a website which would allow users to access material from the band (songs, videos, etc.) in a way which was pleasing to the eye and easy for users to navigate. 

This included using 60s style colors and fonts, mixed with a black and white theme, to create a nostalgic feel while also giving off a real 60s feel. 

As the band were also looking to get across their availability for performing at events, I included various call to action buttons linking to a form page, where users could get in contact with the band for such purposes. 

The "Functions" page also acts as a quick stop for information on what The Monkees can offer for such events, including links to a wedding set list and a brochure for christmas parties. 

 

# UX 

This website has three primary parties involved – The Monkees as the business, established fans and new users looking for a wedding/Christmas party band. 

**The Monkees:** As the band, we want to use this website to promote our availability to perform at weddings and Christmas parties, as well as promote their music. As such, the initial page gives a quick intro into us with an embedded video of a performance by us. Through this, we are giving an impression of what we are about, and the quality of our musicianship. The “About” section then give more details on us as musicians, focussing on the instruments we play. This demonstrates what we have to offer in relation to instruments for their performances. The “Catalogue” page then gives some more examples of songs we have released, giving users more of an understanding of our style of music and repertoire. The “Functions” page provides further details into the services we offer in relation to the two types of events we are focussing on promoting ourselves for (namely Weddings and Christmas Parties), providing a sample set list/brochure to provide further details on exactly what we offer for these events. There is also a “Book Us” button at the bottom of this section, as a call to action to book us. The final “Contact Us” page provides a form for booking, which is our primary goal. There are three ways of getting to this page, with two of these on each page – The button on the nav at the top of each page, the contact button in the footer, and the “Book Us” button in the “Functions” page. As such, users have many opportunities to arrive at this page. 

 

**Established fans:** As an established fan, I want to be able to access material by The Monkees, as well as keep up with their social media. As such, this website gives samples of their music through the introductory video on the home page and the audio clips on the catalogue page. It also allows me to access more information on the members of the band in the about page, with links to their Wikipedia pages. As I am a fan of the band, I am delighted to see they are now providing music for functions such as weddings and Christmas parties, as seen on their functions page. As such, I would recommend friends looking for a good band to look up this website, which has a useful booking form they could utilise to find prices/dates/set lists/etc. 

 

**New Users:**  As a new user, with a particular interest in booking The Monkees for a function such as a wedding or Christmas party, I am looking to see what the band can offer. As such, I like the quick introduction I see on their home page (blurb and video) – this gives me a quick sense of the band before I look into them in more detail by navigating the rest of the website. I can get a better sense of their style of music from the audio clips on the catalogue page. My main focus is the functions page, which I am delighted to see has a sample set list for weddings and a sample brochure for Christmas parties. These give good detail about what they can offer me if I do decide to book them for such a function. I also see it is quite easy for me to book them and send any inquiries I may have through their contact/booking form, with several buttons linking me to this form.

# Features 

**Existing Features** 

* Navbar buttons - allows users to navigate the website. These include a hover animation to assist users in seeing which page they are targeting, and also stay in this black and white colour theme once selected, so users know at all times what section of the website they are currently on. 

* Video – allows users to see a video of a performance by the band. 

* Image links – allow users to access the musicians individual Wikipedia pages so they can access additional information on them. These open on a separate tab. 

* Audio media players – allow users to play specific songs on the website 

* Function set list/brochure links – allow users to access to an external pdf detailing their wedding set list/brochure. These also have hover animations to draw users’ attention to the fact that they are clickable links. 

* ‘Book Us’ button – call to action for users to access the contact/booking form. This also have hover animations to draw users’ attention to the fact that they are clickable links. 

* Contact/booking form – allows users to contact the band, to look for booking dates, rates, etc. 

* Footer – Provides users with copyright information, a contact link and social media links – the contact and social media links also have hover animations to draw users’ attention to the fact that they are clickable links. The social media links also open the linked sites in a new tab. 

**Features Left to Implement** 

* Contact button in footer as a modal – this may work more easily for users and is something which could be included in future models of the site.

### Responsiveness of site: 

To aid in creating a responsive site, I used Bootstrap’s Grid System. Through the creating of each page, I would check the various break points to see if the column sizes worked with the design on various device screen sizes, using Chrome Dev Tools, my own iPhone 8 and an iPad Pro (10.5). 

 

**Header:** I have 5 buttons that I wanted to arrange differently for the various device sizes so that these were still visible and prominent. As such, I had them in a line on desktop, two rows with 2 on top and 3 on the bottom at tablet view, and three rows with the home button on top (to show its importance as the index page), with 2 then on the other 2 rows. I felt that this was the most visually pleasing way of arranging them, while also still displaying the order of importance of these buttons through sizes and row placements (top row being most important). 

 

**Sections:** The Grid System aided me greatly in arranging the sections for each page. 

In the “About” page, I had an interesting issue where one of the sections was moving to the next row unexpectedly. It turned out that the width of one of the images I used (although was being resized in the browsers) was causing the issue, and resizing the jpeg file in Cloud9 alleviated the issue. 

The images and video were causing some issues sizing wise for different devices, mainly at mobile level. Through researching methods to alleviate this, I found that adding height: auto; with a specified width (either 100% or 50%) allowed these elements to automatically resize for different mobile screen sizes, thus solving my issue. 

Due to the arrangement I wanted for the sections in the “Functions” page (where the first section had the image first and the second section had the image last), I saw that although it looked fine for tablets and desktops, at mobile level it looked a bit strange. As such, I copied the text div of the second section and placed it after the image, adding hidden-xs  to the first div, and hidden-sm, hidden-md, hidden-lg to the second, so that the text would appear before the image on mobile, while keeping the desired design for all other devices. 

 

**Footer:** The Grid system once again worked well to get the three sections I wanted for the footer, horizontally on desktop and tablet, and vertically on mobile. However, I encountered an issue where the footer was not staying at the bottom of the page, due to the section not filling the page (e.g. the “Home” page). My tutor recommended that I fix the footer to the bottom, which did sort the issue, but I did not like the feel of it on all device sizes. As such, I kept the fixed footer on desktop, but removed this property on mobile and tablet, where I felt it looked quite bulky and obtrusive to the page content. 

 

# Deployment 

I created a repository on GitHub, linking my project on Cloud9 to it. I committed and pushed content to this repository at various stages of the project (e.g. when I had the structure of a page completed or when I had a page fully structured and styled). I went into the settings tab on GitHub, and under the GitHub section I changed the source to the master branch. This allowed me to generate a GitHub Pages site for my project. This was incredibly useful in testing the site, as outlined above, and also in relation to file paths for the media I was using on the page. This was as a result of using the file paths given by Cloud9 (by right clicking the media item and selecting “Copy file path”, which worked on the Cloud9 preview, but did not work on the deployed GitHub Pages page. As such, I needed to investigate this, and found some great feedback on slack, directing me to change /assets/ to ../ in order to move up a directory so that I could then have my file path going into the images directory and then to my desired image (or video directory for the video in that case).
