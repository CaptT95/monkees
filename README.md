# The Monkees 

Deployed website: https://marksheehan72.github.io/monkees/

**The brief for this project is as follows:** 

>CREATE A WEBSITE FOR A BAND 
>
>Build a static (front-end only) website for a band. As a starting point, you may want to use wireframes, as we did in the UX lesson (you can use Balsamiq or any other tool, including just pen and paper). You can use either your assets or the assets within the following GitHub repo. 
>
>The band is a 1960’s rock band and have around 50 years’ experience of performing live at numerous events around the world. You have been given the following requirements after interviews with the client’s representatives: 
>
>Their primary target audiences are their fans and potential fans who wish to use the site to see and hear clips from their back catalogue, and any new material as it becomes available. 
>
>Also, the band would like to use the site to showcase their music and publicise their availability to perform at events such as weddings and Christmas parties. 
>
>The band has provided you, the developer, with the following assets that they would like to showcase on their website: 
>
>Photos of the band members 
>
>A video clip 
>
>Audio clips 
>
>Also, they are in the process of creating a social media presence and would like to add links to their Facebook, Twitter and YouTube pages. 

As such, I set about creating a website which would allow users to access material from the band (songs, videos, etc.) in a way which was pleasing to the eye and easy for users to navigate. 

This included using 60s style colors and fonts, mixed with a black and white theme, to create a nostalgic feel while also giving off a real 60s feel. 

As the band were also looking to get across their availability for performing at events, I included various call to action buttons linking to a form page, where users could get in contact with the band for such purposes. 

The "Functions" page also acts as a quick stop for information on what The Monkees can offer for such events, including links to a wedding set list and a brochure for christmas parties. 

 

# UX 

This website has three primary parties involved – The Monkees as the business, established fans and new users looking for a wedding/Christmas party band. The user stories for these parties are as follows:

**The Monkees:** 
* We want to promote our music.
* We want to give information on the band.
* We want to give information on our ability to perform at functions (i.e. Weddings and Christmas Parties), including set lists and brochures.
* We want users to be able to book us for these functions through the site.

**Established fans:** 
* We want to be able to listen to the band's music.
* We want to be able to access the band's social media sites.
* We want to be able to access information on the band's new venture playing for various functions.
* We want to be able to book the band/request a cost for booking them..
 

**New Users:**  
* We want a quick introduction of the band.
* We want to be able to listen to samples of their music.
* We want to find information on the band's ability to play for various functions, as well as sample set lists/information brochures for what they offer for these functions.
* We want to be able to book the band/request a cost for booking them.
 

Please see the [*Wireframes*](https://github.com/MarkSheehan72/monkees/tree/master/wireframes) directory in the project for wireframes of each page of the project. 

# Features 

**Existing Features** 

* Navbar buttons - allows users to navigate the website. These include a hover animation to assist users in seeing which page they are targeting, and also stay in this black and white colour theme once selected, so users know at all times what section of the website they are currently on. 

* Video – allows users to see a video of a performance by the band. 

* Image links – allow users to access the musicians individual Wikipedia pages so they can access additional information on them. These open on a separate tab. 

* Audio media players – allow users to play specific songs on the website 

* Function set list/brochure links – allow users to access to an external pdf detailing their wedding set list/brochure. These also have hover animations to draw users’ attention to the fact that they are clickable links. 

* ‘Book Us’ button – call to action for users to access the contact/booking form. This also have hover animations to draw users’ attention to the fact that they are clickable links. 

* Contact/booking form – allows users to contact the band, to look for booking dates, rates, etc. 

* Footer – Provides users with copyright information, a contact link and social media links – the contact and social media links also have hover animations to draw users’ attention to the fact that they are clickable links. The social media links also open the linked sites in a new tab. 

**Features Left to Implement** 

* Contact button in footer as a modal – this may work more easily for users and is something which could be included in future models of the site.

### Responsiveness of site: 

To aid in creating a responsive site, I used Bootstrap’s Grid System. Through the creating of each page, I would check the various break points to see if the column sizes worked with the design on various device screen sizes, using Chrome Dev Tools, my own iPhone 8 and an iPad Pro (10.5). 

 

**Header:** I have 5 buttons that I wanted to arrange differently for the various device sizes so that these were still visible and prominent. As such, I had them in a line on desktop, two rows with 2 on top and 3 on the bottom at tablet view, and three rows with the home button on top (to show its importance as the index page), with 2 then on the other 2 rows. I felt that this was the most visually pleasing way of arranging them, while also still displaying the order of importance of these buttons through sizes and row placements (top row being most important). 

 

**Sections:** The Grid System aided me greatly in arranging the sections for each page. 

In the “About” page, I had an interesting issue where one of the sections was moving to the next row unexpectedly. It turned out that the width of one of the images I used (although was being resized in the browsers) was causing the issue, and resizing the jpeg file in Cloud9 alleviated the issue. 

The images and video were causing some issues sizing wise for different devices, mainly at mobile level. Through researching methods to alleviate this, I found that adding height: auto; with a specified width (either 100% or 50%) allowed these elements to automatically resize for different mobile screen sizes, thus solving my issue. 

Due to the arrangement I wanted for the sections in the “Functions” page (where the first section had the image first and the second section had the image last), I saw that although it looked fine for tablets and desktops, at mobile level it looked a bit strange. As such, I copied the text div of the second section and placed it after the image, adding hidden-xs  to the first div, and hidden-sm, hidden-md, hidden-lg to the second, so that the text would appear before the image on mobile, while keeping the desired design for all other devices. 

 

**Footer:** The Grid system once again worked well to get the three sections I wanted for the footer, horizontally on desktop and tablet, and vertically on mobile. However, I encountered an issue where the footer was not staying at the bottom of the page, due to the section not filling the page (e.g. the “Home” page). My tutor recommended that I fix the footer to the bottom, which did sort the issue, but I did not like the feel of it on all device sizes. As such, I kept the fixed footer on desktop, but removed this property on mobile and tablet, where I felt it looked quite bulky and obtrusive to the page content. 

 

# Deployment 

I created a repository on GitHub, linking my project on Cloud9 to it. I committed and pushed content to this repository at various stages of the project (e.g. when I had the structure of a page completed or when I had a page fully structured and styled). I went into the settings tab on GitHub, and under the GitHub section I changed the source to the master branch. This allowed me to generate a GitHub Pages site for my project. This was incredibly useful in testing the site, as outlined above, and also in relation to file paths for the media I was using on the page. This was as a result of using the file paths given by Cloud9 (by right clicking the media item and selecting “Copy file path”, which worked on the Cloud9 preview, but did not work on the deployed GitHub Pages page. As such, I needed to investigate this, and found some great feedback on slack, directing me to change /assets/ to ../ in order to move up a directory so that I could then have my file path going into the images directory and then to my desired image (or video directory for the video in that case).
